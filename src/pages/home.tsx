      <Paragraph>
        I've worked on a significant project for a prominent fast-food
        corporation, leveraging React, React Native and styled components
        technologies. I've played a crucial role in ensuring seamless business
        rule integration while contributing to the migration of their
        application from React to React Native. The responsibilities encompassed
        managing complex migrations, guaranteeing the fidelity of business
        logic, and facilitating a smooth transition between platforms.
        Additionally, collaborated closely with the development team to create
        and implement essential components, enhancing the overall user
        experience.

      <Paragraph>
        Engaged with a forward-thinking startup operating in the health sector,
        where I played a pivotal role in developing a robust mobile application
        using React Native. Leveraged serverless architecture on AWS Lambda to
        ensure secure and efficient data processing. Managed sensitive
        health-related data and tackled intricate health-related calculations
        integral to the application's functionality, ensuring accurate and
        reliable results. Styled Components and Reanimated were utilized to
        create a polished and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall
        user experience and contributing to the startup's mission of providing
        innovative solutions in the healthcare domain.

        Worked as a Full-stack developer for a fast-growing fitness company with
        $80M+ revenue per year, using a diverse stack for both frontend and
        backend. Responsible for creating and maintaining functionalities,
        developing technical solution, and delivering in production, in websites
        using ELM, React, Sass, and CSS animations, following BEM methodology,
        supporting a variety of devices and browsers, building everything
        responsive with a mobile-first approach, following a Design Systems
        documented in Figma. On the backend side, I've helped adding new API
        endpoints using elixir, and migrating the monolith server using PHP to
        microservices with Elixir.

      <Paragraph>
        As a Full-stack developer, I initiated the frontend development of a
        real estate transactions platform from scratch. Employing React with
        Typescript, ESLint, Prettier, and Sass while adhering to BEM principles,
        I crafted the tool for managing real estate transactions. This involved
        implementing a design system and maintaining a StoryBook client to
        document and referencing existing components. On the backend, I've
        created a data migration solution for a comprehensive back-office
        management product tailored for real estate operations. Leveraging
        Elixir with Phoenix, I've worked on the migration of intricate data from
        various spreadsheets, effectively preserving essential relationships and
        enabling smooth transition to the new system.

        connecting the backend with Apollo. Used a mobile-first approach,
        handling the app‚Äôs state with Redux and creating multiple complex forms.
